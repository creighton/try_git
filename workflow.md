### Fork
Go to the Experience API repository. Fork the repository to your own account using 
the "Fork" button on the top right of Experience API repository page. This makes a 
copy of the Experience API repository. This fork gives you the ability to edit your 
version of the document without impacting the master copy.

### Edit using GitHub's interface
GitHub gives you the ability to edit documents in your repository directly from the 
site. Every file listed appears as a link, which shows the contents of that file when 
clicked. When viewing the file, click the "Edit" button at the top right corner of the 
file to begin editing. When you are finished editing, fill in the "Commit summary" and 
"Extended description" (if needed) to describe your change. Then click the "Commit" 
button at the bottom right of the page. This commits your change to your local repository.

### Submit a pull request
When you forked from the Experience API repository, a link back to the base repository 
is remembered. To send your changes back the the base repository, click the "Pull Request" 
button at the top of your repository page. This will direct you to a page that gives 
you the ability to submit a request to the base repository to merge in the changes you 
committed.
